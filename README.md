## Project Description: <br>

### Summary: What problem or pain point does it solve?
This is kind of a study guide, spell out the code terminology and when you complete it can bring up an example or description of what the code function does. Then you can play another round.  <br>
Recreation of NewYork Times WORDLE game, instead using 5-letter code terminology that we've learned so far. <br>
User will be able to add a guess by using an on-screen keyboard, the guess will display within tiles above the keyboard.  <br>
If the letters are wrong the letters will shake, if they are correct they will turn an appropriate color: blue for correct; pink for correct but in the wrong index.  <br>
Once the user gets the correct answer the tiles will dance!  <br>
Once the game is over (on win or on loss) the word and word description will display on screen and will allow the user to click results and enter a new html page display parameters that are stored in the local storage.  <br>
The site will also include a separate Meet the Team page, with little blurbs about each member and links to each persons individual github profile.  <br>


### MVP:  <br>
Would be a handful of viable products within the game (4) <br>
when you succeed it displays a description of the concept <br>
Local data storage will store: 
- Rounds played
- Win percent
- current streak
- best streak
 
Constructor <br>
Create Words to be guessed, and description of that word.  <br>

### Stretch goals: 
Have a CSS change the color of the letters once you get the letter correct and in the correct location or correct and in the wrong location <br>
Have the game display if a word is not in the object and make it not count as a guess against them <br>
Have the tiles apply a CSS animation on incorrect guess and correct word guess <br>
